### Idea:

- A web app that allows users to generate recipes based on queries they input, using OpenAI's API the web server can send such requests to chatgpt, then return them in
JSON format predefined by us. Users have to create accounts in order to be able to save the recipes on the database and also share them with others. They can also ask for live assistance
from a chatbot if they're trying to follow a recipe and get stuck. (small chance of implementing this too: the app will provide users with links from where they can buy the ingredients
necessary for the recipe from close stores)
